# RecipeFinder
A python tkinter window used for searching and storing recipes

#Purpose
Opens a window with the a search field and results field.
Keywords in seach field are checked against known recipes (stored in "recipes.txt")
Results that contain all keywords are displayed

Clicking "add recipe" on the top bar opens a new window that allows you to add a new recipe to the save file

#Future plans
When a certain result is clicked it will open a new window displaying ingredients and other info for that recipe

#Only tested with Python 3.3!
It could probably be adapted for python 2 fairly easily though
