# RecipeFinder
A python tkinter window used for searching and storing recipes

##Purpose
-Opens a window with the a search field and results field.

-Keywords in search field are checked against known recipes (stored in "recipes.txt")

-Results that contain all keywords are displayed

Clicking "add recipe" on the top bar opens a new window that allows you to add a new recipe to the save file

###Only tested with Python 3.3!
It could probably be adapted for python 2 fairly easily though

##Future plans
-When a certain result is clicked it will open a new window displaying ingredients and other info for that recipe

-Format output text to be prettier

-adjust search accuracy down if no results are found
